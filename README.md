# AKM Model Translation from R to Python

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Abowd, Kramarz, and Margolis (1999) **AKM two-way fixed effects model**, translated from an original R implementation by Stephen Tino (University of Toronto). The AKM model is widely used in labor economics to estimate worker and firm contributions to earnings inequality using matched employer-employee data.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Goals  
- Convert the R-based AKM estimation to Python  
- Maintain equivalent model estimation, variance decomposition, and fixed-effects computation  
- Extend the model to support **gender-specific AKM estimation**  

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure  
- `r_version/` â€“ Original R scripts for reference  
- `python_version/` â€“ Translated Python implementation  
- `data/` â€“ Simulated employer-employee dataset for testing  
- `README.md` â€“ Project documentation  

## ðŸ”— Original R-based Implementation  
The original R implementation was developed by **Stephen Tino (University of Toronto)**.
